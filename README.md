# TripleBarrel
I will use three separate ways to try and predict the SPY market using strategies like mean reversion z score, pair trading, etc.


Anyways, the number before each file is the sequence of where I started and how I progressed, there are some code sample from AI, 
but as you can see, some of the ideas and code are too simple and dumb to be AI generated anyway, I need to actually learn how to
do this myself, to generate maximum alpha, gl to you if you reading this.
